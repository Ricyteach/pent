Nomenclature and Definitions
============================

``pent`` searches text in a line-by-line fashion,
where a line of text is delimited by the start/end
of the string, and/or by newline(s).

Each line of text to be matched by ``pent`` is represented
by a *pattern*, passed into a |Parser|.
Each *pattern* is composed of zero or more whitespace-separated *tokens*,
which define in a structured way what the overall *pattern* should match.
